                <p class="about">Riverside Dog Walkers is a local dog walking business with the goal of giving you and your dog the best experience possible.
                    <br>We are a group of college students who share the love of dogs and all animals alike, with many of us in veterinarian school perusing<br>a rewarding career in helping less than fortunate furry friends. We know how difficult it can be to make time for our pets thats why<br>we are here to offer our services.</p>
            <h2>How to get started</h2>
                <p class="about">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
